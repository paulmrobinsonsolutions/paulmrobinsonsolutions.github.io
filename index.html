          In general, colleagues know me as a highly motivated, forward-thinking perfectionist (it's a blessing and a curse) that will
          figure out a problem, then automate it. If asked, they'd likely say I'm a stickler for standards, consistency/frameworks 
          and well, automation in any way shape or form. If something needs to be doen twice then it's going to get automated. Then we
          can just click a button, or even have it just trigger from some event. And then grab a coffee. Who's doesn't love coffee? Right?

          Secondly, people would mention my passion for understanding data, data analysis, and data-driven solutions. This includes 
          rooting around a given database to understand schemas, relationships, structures, organization of data, indexes, queries, 
          etc. in order to bring data together for functional purposes to help people make informed decisions.
        <p>
          Lastly, I imagine people would mention my love for collaboration around data and process improvement (which will most likely 
          involve automation in some way). Given the one predominant constant... change! Things continually evolve and change so I 
          like to work with others to understand current challenges to share better ways of doing things. There is ALWAYS opportunity
          to learn something, whether you want to or not, so I throughly enjoy people's views with their own creativity and innovation
          to build a better future. Which I've also found helps me reign in my own creative imagination so I don't go down too many 
          crazy rabbit holes. I mean I did win some art awards along with a few creative writing accolades so yeah, I can get pretty 
          creative. Again... a blessing and a curse.
        </p>

          In any case to wrap things up, I believe that teamwork, an open mind, and ingenuity can create endless possibilities! No 
          matter how complex the problem is, a structured approach can lead to effective solutions... Going from ruin to utopia. 
          I hope the image below captures this sentiment!
