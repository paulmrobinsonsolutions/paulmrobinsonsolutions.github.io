                  <strong>SPOCK</strong> simply put, is your complete Blue Prism (for process automation) production assistant! This tool is your "live" monitoring 
                  assistant to help you manage your automation environment, providing you immediate insights around health of the environment and/or alerts for 
                  proactive issues avoidance. With it's "shell" architecture, it's designed to be a highly customizable and scalable for changing needs where the
                  interface is the "shell" for presentation and interaction purposes only while the heavy lifting, and power, is done through the decoupled SQL
                  queries that are the heart and backbone of this app. Aside from the main view which has a section for recent errors, a section for details 
                  around currently running processes, and a section to estimate expected completion times per process based on volumes and resources utilized... 
                  all other data you want to view is completely customizable by you! You just create the SQL you want, save it to a particular folder and voila, 
                  it's right there at your fingertips to see the data points you want, how you want and most importantly to help you avoid any potential issues. 
                  Which I think we can all agree, it's easier to prevent issues than to fix them, right?

                  and my team. This dynamic query tool allows you to quickly and easily search on any existing object (tables, views, functions) to dig down into 
                  the data you want based on any filtering you want. Data results are then displayed in a dynamic grid view of any results returned while also providing 
                  basic sorting options on all columns returned. You can also export to Excel for even deeper analysis. This provides users with a very flexible, 
                  fast and easy mechanism for in depth data analysis.

                  <strong>DAMU</strong> is designed with agile data movement and data analysis in mind to get the data you want into your favorite data analysis tool 
                  as quickly as possible, or at least in the least amount of steps, to start slicing and dicing that data how you want. This also has some smarts to help protect you
                  protect you from yourself by comparing data types to intelligently build out filter expressions on the fly that will also help avoid data clashes or 
                  data being dropped. For example, you may have several columns of data you want to pull from say an Oracle database into Excel. Based on the source 
                  column data types this tool will provide the correct filter expression options (&gt;, &lt;= or Begins With, Contains, etc.) and it will also will help with
                  data mappings from the source to the target by matching up the source and target column names. There are these little time savings that add up to a lot!

                  regex, basic string manipulations and reading data from text and Excel files. This was really a little sandbox project to play around with Python to see how
                  it compared to other Object-Oriented programming I frequently work with. I have pursued more aspects of Python and have plans to create more purposeful projects
                  with more solid objectives. It is a fun and quite powerful language. And yes, I do intend to write Python-ic code as the saying goes.

                  <strong>ADS</strong> enables you to quickly search Active Directory to find users, security groups, roles, etc.
                  Let's say you manage access to/for various things like file shares, SharePoint, AD groups, MS Entra ID, Azure Key vault, Virtual Machines, etc. 
                  and one day you're told a contractor contract has ended and now you have to remove access to sooo many things BUT in typical fashion, you only 
                  get a piece of information and you need more info to figure out who's network account is about to lose ALL access. I mean removing someone's 
                  access and giving them a day off could be really bad.. in the eyes of a manager. Soo, to be sure you don't make that "mistake", this little 
                  AD searcher provides a flexible interface to quickly query Active Directory with results returned in a clean grid format that also provides
                  interactive sorting to be sure you find that user account that is going to lose all access. This tool also shows security groups for those 
                  times when say, Aria says she needs the same file share access as Tyrion and Jon but for some reason she can't access the file share. Well, 
                  is it because she's not in some security group that Tyrion and Jon are?
