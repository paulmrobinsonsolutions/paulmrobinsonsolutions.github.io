                  <strong>ARC</strong> is an Azure CLI script that automates the deletion of files on Azure resources to keep VMs running smoothly 
                  and efficiently. Through dynamic scripting, this script works through a range of Azure resources (VMs) targeting pre-defined folders
                  and files to delete such as temp files, log files, and other unnecessary files that accumulate over time. This script will ensure
                  that Virtual Machines have enough free disk space for optimal performance.

                  <strong>This App Installer</strong> script was originally created to assist our IT VM maintenance team with an urgent app install to patch a
                  security non-compliance risk of an out-dated app version so a new version needed to be pushed asap. The challenge... the Azure infrastructure
                  consisted 150+ Virtual Machines, a daunting, time consuming manual effort that would have taken a sifnicant amount of time to complete with a
                  high degree of error. So to combat the effort, I created this script to completely automate the installation process which also included the
                  ability to step through the installation wizard screens. All you had to do was kick off the PowerShell script then check 20 or so minutes later
                  when it would have completed and verify results with a nice display log of all activities done. Pretty slick! <br />
                  In a nutshell... the script copied installation files files to the target VM, verified a few things, started the installer, stepped through the 
                  installation wizard UI, and then performed post-installation tasks such as the cleanup of all files no longer needed after a successful install.

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <strong>FLI</strong> was born out of necessity to keep an eye on a particular folder that would frequently have files locked 
                  by our OCR software. Since the OCR application folks were unable to find the root cause or a way to handle things, with
                  many meetings to troubleshoot the issue, I dug in and found that certain files were the problem. I then figured out how
                  the OCR app worked through the files in the folder and simply by moving the offending file(s), the OCR app would then 
                  pick back up processing as expected. Thus, this script came to life and could be scheduled to run from anywhere to watch 
                  over things and move the "bad" files to a central location (folder) to be manually reviewed by Business folks. Aside from 
                  averting days of lost time, this script also provided a way to quickly identify the "bad" files causing the issue which 
                  could then be quickly removed ensuring operations could continue without interruption.

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <strong>Delete Oldest Folder</strong> script was a way to combat cleanup efforts for a few processes that simply did not have any
                  mechanism in place to cleanup "old" folders/files so the number of folders/files just grew each day taking up more and more space
                  which caused serious degradation in performance. So once this issue was identified, I created this script to quickly get something
                  in place to delete folders/files to recover performance. Since all processes had a standard folder structure and a "daily work"
                  folder that was created each day to keep all files needed to perform work on a given day, the "daily work" folders were timestamped
                  and therefore, could be evaluated to determine the oldest folder. Due to timeout issues given the size and/or sheer number of files,
                  this script only deletes one subfolder each run, the oldest folder. It just made for a clear and obvious distinction, as well.
