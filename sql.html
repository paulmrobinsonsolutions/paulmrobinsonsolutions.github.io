                  <strong>The Report Generator</strong> is a dynamic SQL script to extract and transform report data contained in a particular
                  field in a certain table. This field's data was stored in an XML structure and this XML structure would for each automated process.
                  And given there were close to 150 processes, you can see how this would be a daunting task and not feasible to create and maintain
                  queries specific to each process. So instead, I created a single stored procedure that could dynamically parse the XML data and then
                  transform the XML into the specific report structure/format for each process. Regardless to say, this significantly minimized technical
                  debt and maintenance and well, it was very fun to create. I even looked like a magician soo bonus there!

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <strong>ASQM</strong> was created to estimate when automated processes would finish all of their items to work. Just like the first
                  stored procedure (described above) the purpose of this one was also to fill gaps to better support automated Production processes
                  which in turn would enable us to provide better service offerings. This stored procedure helped keep a pulse on how Production 
                  processes were running while it's most beneficial purpose was to calculate when a process was expected to finish working all pending
                  / queued items. Several factors were taken into consideration like, the number of pending items, number of machines running the process,
                  and the average handle time of each item (per process). Other beneficial data points were included in the results to provide a clearer
                  picture of processing health like, number of items completed, number of items with errors, number of pending items and average item work
                  time across running process sessions. All of this information pulled together significantly helped to quickly identify how well things
                  were running, if there were any issues, and most importantly when a process was expected to finish. This was critical since the big 
                  question that was always asked... when will a process finish? Thus, the "Ask 'em" phrase was born where I'd get asked a lot. I mean A LOT! lol

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <strong>The Get Top N Utilization</strong> was another stored procedure to gather data around bot/resource utilization to gage how productive,
                  or not, particular machines, bots (network logins) and/or machine resources were being utilized within a particular date range. This was also 
                  based on Business Area since each Business Area should be limited to it's own process data and ultimately FTE costs, systems used, and support
                  time would only apply to each individual Business Area for my team's service cost structure. I like this query because based on the database
                  table relationships and structure I feel like this was a creative way to mash up different pieces of data to get really good insights that
                  dramatically brought attention to process / bot utilization which gave clear insights into time spent which correlates to money so you know
                  where money is being spent and/or saved. For example, one process may provided signficant savings while another process may be experiencing
                  issues often so it's not being utilized well enough to save money. Which could also be an indicator that process improvement may be needed.

                  <strong>THE Daily Workload Manager</strong> simply manages daily operations of incoming work and work not yet fulfilled. This stored procedure was
                  the backbone to feed data to an automated processes that would schedule field work in the respective Customer Service System. This query managed
                  the day-to-day operations with work items to schedules, backing up work items, archiving work items, synching previously archived items, and more.
                  The thing I like most about this stored procedure is it's use of A.C.I.D. SQL techniques to keep data pristine while it's also very methodical and
                  efficient cleansing and moving data. And it ultimately performed so well with efficiencies that it had to be scaled back to allow for more time
                  between scheduled work in order to account for emergency work that could arise any given day.

                  <strong>The Holiday Date Check</strong> is a fun little SQL scalar function that determines if a date falls on a holiday. A date is paassed in as
                  a parameter and then goes through various date evaluations based on US holidays. The cool thing is that this can be easily extended to contain any
                  date that would be considered a holiday. The purpose of this script was to feed into other scheduling stored procedures and functions to validate
                  a given date did or did not fall on a holiday, depending on the purpose of the over archiving query that would call this scalar function.
